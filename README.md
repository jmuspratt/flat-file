# ðŸ“¸ Flat File

Flat File creates web galleries from directories of images, video and text files. There's no CMS or admin â€”Â just sFTP and date-based file-naming conventions.

- Upload a directory of
- Add text files to insert headings. Using


Built with PHP, [Ups-dock](http://github.com/Upstatement/ups-dock), and vanilla CSS.

## Requirements
 - A web server with sFTP access
 - PHP
 - PHP's GD library for image processing)
 - [FFMpeg](https://ffmpeg.org) for video encoding
 - [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)

## Installation
1. Edit `www/app/config.php` with details from your server
2. Upload the contents of `/www/` to your server
3. Set the permissions of `albums` and `albums-processed` to `777`

## Adding albums
1. Createa a new folder locally with a date-based prefix defined in config.php (default is `YYYY-MM-DD-My-Album-Name`)
2. Export your images using the date-based-prefix. [Exiftool](https://exiftool.org) and [a shell script](https://gist.github.com/jmuspratt/3680d45b0c12f8b32093) are useful here if your local photo software doesn't give you enough flexibility.
3. Insert any text files to serve as headings above a group of photos, using a date-based prefix to position the heading where you want in the alphabetical file sequence . Something like `2020-05-01-Hiking-in-the-alps.txt` will render as `Hiking in the Alps` right before . You can also add secondary text in the contents of the text file.
4. Visit your site, click the album, and wait for media processing to complete. Subsequent page views will be much faster.

## Development progress


### Done
- Date-prefixed albums
- Date-prefixed text files for outputting heading separators
- Native responsive images (`srcset` and `sizes`)
- Native lazyloading with `loading=lazy`
- Image processing with the GD library
- Video processing (to 720p mp4) with [PHP-FFMPEG](https://github.com/PHP-FFMpeg/PHP-FFMpeg)

### To Do
- [ ] Enlargeable images and video in a modal on click
- [ ] Honor non-16Ã—9 video aspect ratios when processing
- [ ] Improve display of headings on mobile
- [ ] UI to step through albums from album view
